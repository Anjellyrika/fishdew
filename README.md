# ðŸŽ£Fishdew
For my first game development project using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), I've decided to recreate the popular fishing mechanic from one of my favorite games: [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/)!

Special thanks to my friend Joshua ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/englishrazor/), @englishrazor on Discord) for creating the fish and treasure chest sprites!

Original game concept is by [ConcernedApe](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), the creator of Stardew Valley
